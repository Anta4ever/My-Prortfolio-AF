    I am currently studying Cyber Security at the University of New Haven.
    I am a sophomore and I'm excited to work with my team!
</p>
<p> I also love to travel so here is an image of me during my high school field trip to Europe!</p>

<p> My favorite place to visit was Germany because of the great food, 
    however I loved Switzerland because of the Swiz chocolate and the Swiz Alps!</p>
